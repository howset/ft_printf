# ft_printf

This is the frist project of the circle that I worked on. It was already recommended to me to **not** go for the bonus to save myself from headaches.

Overall the project is not very complicated. Only one of the main file was copied from someone else in the net for presentation purposes during the eval. The general idea is quite straight-forward, just go over the input string and print the characters until an identifier is found. This identifier is then checked by an ID checker function that would in turn calls the correspoding function to print it.
